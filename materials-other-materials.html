    <h1>Other Materials</h1>

    <p>In addition to the yarn and hooks, there are a few other materials that will be useful!</p>

    <h2>Scissors</h2>

    <p>A pair of scissors is needed to cut your yarn once you have finished a project. Any scissors 
        will do as long as they are sharp another to make a clean cut! A dull pair of scissors will 
        fray the yarn.</p>

    <p>I like to use sewing scissors as they are easier to travel with, but the scissors you have at 
        home will do just fine!</p>

    <h2>Yarn Needle</h2>

    <p>When you finish a project, there will be to pieces of yarn hanging off. However, you can't 
        simply cut them as it can cause your work to unravel! Additionally, some projects- such as 
        stuffed animals and sweaters- require pieces to be stitched together.</p>

    <p>A yarn needle will allow you to weave the ends of the yarn into your finished pieces as well 
        as stitch pieces of a project together. These needles have a big eye and a dull point, so 
        they are easy a safe to use.</p>

    <h2>Stitch Markers</h2>

    <p>As the name suggests, stitch markers help you keep track of your stitches. If you are making 
        a very large project, like a blanket, and have very long rows, these will help you keep 
        track of how many stitches you have completed. They also help keep track of rows if you 
        are working in a magic circle as they can very easily blend into each other.</p>

    <p>Stitch markers are by no means required to crochet, but I highly recommend using them. They 
        will make you life much easier and save you a lot of time!</p>
    
    <h2>Where Do I Get All This Stuff?</h2>

    <p>I just named a lot of materials for you to get your hands on, but don't fret! Everything can 
        be found in your local craft store or online, and they can often be found sold in a set.</p>

    <p>
        I use <a href = 'https://www.amazon.com/Sizes-Crochet-Ergonomic-Arthritic-Needles/dp/B07RNNL6RT'>this</a> 
        set of hooks, sewing scissors, yarn needles, and stitch markers; but anything you can find 
        will work perfectly! </p>
