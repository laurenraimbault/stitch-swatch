    <h1>Hooks</h1>

    <p>The next most important item you'll need is a set of hooks to work with your yarn.</p>

    <h2>Size</h2>

    <p>Since yarn comes in a variety of weights, a variety of hooks are needed to work with each 
        one. Heavy weight yarn is worked with a  large hook while light weight yarn is worked with 
        a small hook. (Some yarn is so big that you use your fingers instead of a hook!)</p>

    <p>
        Hook size is described in millimeters (mm) in the UK and letters in the US. The smaller the 
        number/earlier in the alphabet, the smaller the hook; and the larger the number/later in the 
        alphabet, the larger the hook. A 2.75 mm/C hook is very small, and a 19 mm/S hook is very big.</p>

    <h2>Determing Which Hook to Use</h2>

    <p>Knowing which hook to use with each yarn is as easy as looking at the package on the skein. 
        It will specify what the best size hook to use is. Additionally, if you are working from a 
        pattern, the creator will state what type of yarn and what size hook they recommend using.</p>

    <h2>What Hooks Do I Need?</h2>

    <p>You won't need every single crochet hook to begin crocheting! A handful of the most frequently 
        used hooks are all you need. I ones I recommend purchasing are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>4 mm/G-6</li>
        <li>4.5 mm/7</li>
        <li>5 mm/H-8</li>
        <li>5.5 mm/I-9</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Hooks can be bought in a set, and most of them will contain these sizes.</p>
