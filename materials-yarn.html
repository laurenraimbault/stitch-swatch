    <h1>Yarn</h1>

    <p>The most important item youâ€™ll need to buy is yarn! However, you might be overwhelmed when 
        you step into the craft store and see the various different types of yarn available. This 
        page will describe the most common yarn types and which ones are best for beginners.</p>

    <h2>Weight</h2>

    <p>Yarn is described in weight, or thickness. The heavier the weight, the thicker the yarn. The 
        heaviest or thickest yarns are used for blankets, rugs, and other similar projects. The 
        lightest or thinnest yarns are used for embroidery or complex stitches. Average weight yarn 
        is used to create clothing, scarves, stuffed animals, etc.</p>

    <p>Yarn weight is placed on a scale from 0 to 7, and it is displayed on the package containing 
        your yarn. The lower the number, the lighter the yarn; the higher the number, the heavier 
        the yarn.</p>

    <h2>Fiber Types</h2>

    <p>The most common type of yarn is synthetic yarn, and the most common type of synthetic yarn 
        is acrylic yarn. Acrylic yarn is easy to find, cheap, and durable. When you go to the store
        , the majority of the yarn you find will be acrylic. There are other forms of synthetic 
        yarn, such as nylon and rayon, but they are not nearly as abundant as acrylic.</p>

    <p>Yarn can also be composed of animal fibers or plant fibers, but these are more expensive 
        that acrylic yarn.</p>

    <h2>What Should I Buy?</h2>

    <p>The best yarn for a beginner to use is medium weight (also called 'worsted weight') acrylic 
        yarn. It is easy to work with, incredibly durable, and inexpensive!</p>

    <p>You can find yarn readily available at a craft store, online, and even at some major retailers.</p>
